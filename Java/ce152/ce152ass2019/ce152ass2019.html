<h3>Exercise1 [15%] </h3>

<p>This exercise is about writing methods which operate on two-dimensional arrays of
integers. You can assume that these arrays are square – the number of rows and columns of the array are equal. You can also assume each of these arrays has at least one row and that all rows are non-empty. For testing, please use an array with four rows and four columns with the following elements:
</p>
 
<pre> 3 -1  4  0
 5  9 -2  6 
 5  3  7 -8
 2  1  6 -2</pre>

<h4>Part A [5%] </h4>

<p>Create a class <tt>Exercise1</tt>. In this class, write a method </p>
<pre><code class="java">public static int mainDiagonalElementSum(int[][] array)</code></pre>
<p>Given a square 2D array, the method should return the sum of its elements which are on the main diagonal. For example, if applied to the test array, the result should be 3+9+7+(-2) = 17. Write a method <tt>main()</tt> which applies <tt>mainDiagonalElementSum</tt> to the test array. Display the method result and check that it is correct.
</p> 

<h4>Part B [5%] </h4>

<p>In class <tt>Exercise1</tt> write a method </p>
<pre><code class="java">public static int maxRowAbsSumValue(int[][] array)</code></pre>
<p>Given a square 2D array, the method should compute for each row the sum of the absolute values of the elements of that row. The method should return the maximum of these sums. For example, if applied to the test array, the method should return the value max (3+1+4+0, 5+9+2+6, 5+3+7+8, 2+1+6+2) = max (8,22,23,11) = 23. Add code to method <tt>main()</tt> which applies <tt>maxRowAbsSumValue</tt> to the test array. Display the method result and check that it is correct.
</p> 


<h4>Part C [5%] </h4>

<p>In class <tt>Exercise1</tt> write a method </p>
<pre><code class="java">public static int maxColumnAbsSumValue(int[][] array)</code></pre>
<p>Given a square 2D array, the method should compute for each column the sum of the absolute values of the elements of that column. The method should return the maximum of these sums. For example, if applied to the test array, the method should return the value max (3+5+5+2, 1+9+3+1, 4+2+7+6, 0+6+8+2) = max (15,14,19,16) = 19. Add code to method <tt>main()</tt> which applies <tt>maxColumnAbsSumValue</tt> to the test array. Display the method result and check that it is correct. 
</p>

	<hr> 

	<h3>Exercise2 [15%] </h3>

<p>This exercise is about writing programs for practicing complementation of 2 given numbers.</p> 

<h4>Part A [9%] </h4>

<p>Write a class <tt>Exercise2</tt> with a method </p>
<pre><code class="java">public static void partA()</code></pre>
<p>The method should feature a loop that runs 5 times. In each step of the loop, the program should: </p> <ul>
	   <li>Generate two random integer numbers in the range 10 to 20 (inclusive). </li>
	   <li>Ask the user to compute the remainder obtained by dividing two numbers.</li>
	   <li>Check the answer entered by the user. Inform the user if the answer was correct or not. You can assume that the user input is an integer number.  </li>
	   <li>Display the current scores (20 marks for each correct answer), the number of the correct answers and the total numbers of answers. </li>
   </ul>
<p>Here is log from a sample program run: </p> 
<pre>Exercise 2A
10 % 18 = ?
10
Correct answer, Current score: 20, performance: 1/1
16 % 11 = ?
5
Correct answer, Current score: 40, performance: 2/2
16 % 17 = ?
1
Incorrect answer, Current score: 40, performance: 2/3
17 % 19 = ?
2
Incorrect answer, Current score: 40, performance: 2/4
12 % 16 = ?
12
Correct answer, Current score: 60, performance: 3/5
Finish.
</pre> 
<p>In class <tt>Exercise2</tt>, add a <tt>main()</tt> method which invokes <tt>part</tt>.  Test your program.
</p> 

<h4>Part B [6%]</h4> 

<p>In class <tt>Exercise2</tt>, add a method </p>
	<pre><code class="java">public static void partB()</code></pre>
<p>The program should implement a similar functionality as in Part A - it should repeatedly ask 
	the user to compute the complementation of two randomly generated integers in the range from 10 to 20. There are a couple of differences: 
	<ul>
		<li>The number of complementation problems should not be fixed. Instead, the program should keep posing new complementation problems until the user decides to quit by entering the letter "<tt>q</tt>". 
		</li>
		<li>The program should be able to deal with invalid input by the user. 
			It should ignore such input and restate the current complementation problem. </li> 
    </ul>

<p>Here is log from a sample program run: </p> 
<pre>Exercise 2B
18 % 12 = ?
6
Correct answer, Current score: 20, performance: 1/1
14 % 16 = ?
a
Invalid input
14 % 16 = ?
14
Correct answer, Current score: 40, performance: 2/2
20 % 4 = ?
q
Finish.
</pre> 

<p>Change method <tt>Exercise2.main()</tt> so that it invokes <tt>partB</tt>.  Test your program.	</p> 

<hr> 

	<h3>Exercise3 [15%]</h3>

	<p>A <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number">narcissistic number</a> refers to a 3-digit decimal number which is the sum of the cubes of their digits: (e.g. 1 ^ 3 + 5 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3 = 153).</p>
	
<h4>Part A [10%]</h4> 

<p>Write a class <tt>Exercise3</tt> with a method </p>
	<pre><code class="java">public static boolean isNarcissisticNumber(int number)</code></pre>
<p>The aim of the method is to judge a number which is a narcissistic number or not. If the input parameter is a narcissistic number, the method returns true, conversely, returns false.In class <tt>Exercise3</tt>, add a <tt>main()</tt> method which invokes <tt>isNarcissisticNumber</tt>. Test your program.
</p>

<h4>Part B [5%]</h4> 

<p>Write a class <tt>Exercise3</tt> with a method </p>
	<pre><code class="java">public static int sum()</code></pre>
<p>The aim of the method is to compute the sum of all the narcissistic numbers. Note that narcissistic number is a 3-digit decimal number.In class <tt>Exercise3</tt>, add a <tt>main()</tt> method which invokes <tt>sum</tt>. Test your program.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Exercise4 [15%] </h3>

<p>This exercise is about practicing programming about Java class and objects.</p>

<h4>Part A [10%]</h4>

<p>Create a class <tt>Vehicle</tt> that represents a means of transportation. The class <tt>Vehicle</tt> should have 2 fields, 2 constructors and other 4 member methods:</p> 
Fields:
	<ul>
		<li>A String type.</li>
		<li>A double speed. </li> 
    </ul>
Constructors:
	<ul>
		<li>Vehicle(): a constructor without parameters which initializes the vehicle type to “bicycle”and speed to 20.0 by default. </li>
		<li>Vehicle(String type, double speed): a constructor with 2 parameters which initializes the vehicle type and speed according to the called parameters. </li> 
    </ul>
Methods:
	<ul>
		<li>setType(String type): a method which changes the current vehicle type to the set value.</li>
		<li>setSpeed(double speed): a method which changes the current vehicle speed to the set value.</li> 
		<li>speedUp(): a method which changes the current vehicle speed to speed * 2.</li> 
		<li>speedDown(): a method which changes the current vehicle speed to speed / 2.</li> 
    </ul>
	
<p>Then create a class <tt>Exercise4</tt> with the following method:</p> 
<pre>public static void partA() {
    Vehicle va = new Vehicle ();
    Vehicle vb = new Vehicle ("car", 60.0);
    vb.speedUp();
    System.out.println(va.type + " " + va.speed);
    System.out.println(vb.type + " " + vb.speed);
}
</pre>
<p>In class <tt>Exercise4</tt>, add a <tt>main()</tt> method which invokes <tt>partA</tt>. The output should be:</p> 
<pre>bicycle 20.0
car 120.0
</pre>
	
<h4>Part B [5%]</h4>

<p>In class <tt>Exercise4</tt>, write a method</p>
<pre>public static void partB() {
    String[] typeArray = {"car", "train", "plane", "bicycle",};
    double[] speedArray = {60, 180, 1000, 20};
    TreeSet<Vehicle> vehicles = new TreeSet<>();
    for(int i = 0; i < typeArray.length; i++) {
        vehicles.add(new Vehicle(typeArray[i], speedArray[i]));
    }
}
</pre>
<p>In class <tt>Exercise4</tt>, add code to method <tt>main()</tt> which invokes <tt>partB</tt>. The program output this ERROR: <tt>“Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassCastException: Vehicle cannot be cast to java.base/java.lang.Comparable”</tt>. Please explain why this error occurs and modify the class <tt>Vehicle</tt> to make the program run correctly. </p> 

<hr>

<h3>Exercise5 [20%]</h3>
	<p>This exercise involves writing a program to solve word search
	  puzzles. For example, in the grid below: </p>
	  
<pre>eoksibaebl
ropeneapop
mbrflaoyrm
gciarrnuna
utmoryaply
wnarmutnke
ngrelcbene
alytueruei
fgrammarib
tdcebykxka</pre>
<p>it is possible to find the following word occurrences: </p>
<pre>open: row 1, position 1
bear: column 5, position 0
rope: row 1, position 0
apply: row 4, position 5
apply: column 6, position 3
grammar: row 8, position 1
primary: column 2, position 1
</pre>

	<p>Create a Java class <tt>WordFinder</tt> with code as below. </p>
	<pre>
public class WordFinder {
  public static final int N = 10;
  public static char[][] grid = new char[N][N];
  public static final String GRID_FILE = "data/grid.txt";
  public static final String WORD_FILE = "data/words.txt";

  public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {
    initGrid();
    printGrid();
    // find();
  }
}</pre>
	<p>Then download two files containing the grid and the words to search for: 
  <p class="text-center">
  <a href="https://orb.essex.ac.uk/ce/ce152/restricted/ass/data/grid.txt">grid.txt</a> <br> 
  <a href="https://orb.essex.ac.uk/ce/ce152/restricted/ass/data/words.txt">words.txt</a>
  </p>
  <p>You may have to amend the file paths in your program depending on where you save the files. 
  </p>
	  
	<h4>Part A [5%]</h4> 

	<p>In class <tt>WordFinder</tt>, implement method <tt>initGrid</tt>. This 
      method should store the contents of file <tt>grid.txt</tt> in the 2D <tt>char</tt> array 
	  <tt>grid</tt>  declared as a <tt>static</tt> member of the class. </p>
 <ul>
   <li>The program should read, in turn, each line of the file and write it to the corresponding row 
	 of the array. </li> 
   <li>You can assume that the file contains exactly 10 lines with 10 characters on each line. </li> 
   <li>Grids will contain only lower-case letters. </li>
 </ul>
 <p>Next implement method <tt>printGrid()</tt> which should display the grid on the screen. 
You may want to separate characters by a blank in order to improve legibility.  
 </p> 
 <p>Run the program and check that it inputs and displays the grid correctly. </p> 

	<h4>Part B [15%]</h4> 

	<p>In class <tt>WordFinder</tt>, implement method <tt>find()</tt>. This
	  method should read words from file <tt>words.txt</tt>. For each
	  word, it should search the grid for a horizontal (left-to-right)
	  or vertical (downwards) occurrence. If the word is found in the
	  grid, then it should display the details of the
	  occurrence in a format such as below: 
	</p>
	  <pre>grammar: row 8, position 1</pre>

	  <Ul>
		<li>Please include the row and/or column number and the
		 starting position of the occurrence. Numbering should start at zero as usual.</li> 
		<li>There should be no output for words that do not occur in the grid. </li>
		<li>Words may occur multiple times in a grid. In this case, each occurrence should be reported on a separate 
		  line of the output. </li>
		<li>In file <tt>words.txt</tt>, each line contains exactly one word. </li>
		 <li>Please use <tt>String</tt>
		  method <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#trim--"><tt>trim</tt></a> to remove 
		  leading or trailing whitespace when reading words. </li> 
	  </ul> 

	<hr>
				
<h3>Exercise6 [20%]</h3>

	<p><i>This task requires some material from Week 23. </i> </p>

<p> 
  For this task you should create a class called <tt>BelishaBeacon</tt> that
  provides a 2D graphical animation of the flashing orange lights that
  are used to mark the location of pedestrian crossings – often called
  "Belisha Beacons" (in honour of the Minister of Transport who
  introduced them).</p> 

<p>When the class is run it should display a window similar to the
following:</p> 
<p class="text-center"> 
<img src="./images/belishaBeacon.png" alt="Belisha Beacon"/> 
</p> 
<p>Initially the lamp should flash; that is, its colour should
alternate between orange and light grey with a period of about half a
  second. When the <em>Steady</em> button is clicked the flashing should stop and
  the lamp remain permanently on (i.e. orange); when the <em>Flash</em> button is
pressed, the lamp should resume flashing. Closing the window should
terminate the program. </p> 
<p>The drawing should be constructed from geometrical shapes displayed using Java2D. It 
  should not display an image taken from a file. 
</p>
