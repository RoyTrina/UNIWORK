HOW TO PREPARE YOUR ASSIGNMENT FOR SUBMISSION FROM AN IntelliJ Idea DEVELOPMENT

Any .css and .js files that you have used should have names that are
likely to be unique (use your initials or student id in the filename) so
that when I'm testing the ssignment my browser will not use cached versions
of another student's files.

You should not rename .jsp or .java files

If you've been developing on your own PC or laptop remember to change the URL
in the getConnection call in ShopB.java back to the URL in the original file
obtained from Moodle

The following files need to be in the folder tomcat\webapps\ass2 (please rename
it to ass2 if your folder has a different name):
1 All JSP files
2 Any .css and .js files that you've used (in css and/or js folders if you've
  used them)
3 All shopbd.* files (but NOT shopdb.lck)
4 The complete images and thumbnails folders
5 A copy of the folder WEB_INF which IntelliJ will have built
To obtain it:
(i) Remove any WEB_INF folder that is already in tomcat\webapps\ass2.
(ii) Look in your the folder that contains your IntelliJ project.
     You should find a folder called out, containing a folder called artifacts,
     containing a folder called something like ass2_war_exploded.
     In this folder there will be a folder called WEB_INF; copy it
     directly into M:\tomcat\webapps\ass2

Do not submit hsqldb.jar; I've got a copy in my tomcat\lib folder which will
be used when testing.

If you have time, check that the shop can be accessed from this folder outside IntelliJ by
starting Tomcat as in lab 4 and typing the URL
   //localhost:8080/ass2/index.jsp

You should submit to FASER a zip file containing the complete folder tomcat\webapps\ass2 and also 
copies of all .java files.  (You may if you wish put these into a Java folder in tomcat\webapps\ass2)
Do NOT submit the while of your tomcat or tomcat\webapps folders
